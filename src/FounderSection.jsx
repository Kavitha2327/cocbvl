          <p>
            Mr. Samuel Raj, affectionately known as Bikkavolu Samuel Raj, was a
            humble servant of God whose life was marked by faith, sacrifice, and
            compassion. From a young age, he devoted himself fully to Christ and
            dedicated his life to spreading the Gospel and building God’s kingdom.
          </p>

          <p>
            He began his ministry in 1981 with a small group of believers and went
            on to establish the Bikkavolu Church of Christ. In 1983, he founded the
            Bikkavolu Charitable Society, extending care to the poor and needy by
            providing food, shelter, clothing, education, medical support, and
            counseling across surrounding villages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Living a life of simplicity and discipline, he rose early each day to
            serve widows, orphans, struggling families, and local communities. He
            preached in churches and schools, mentored pastors and missionaries,
            and tirelessly shared God’s love with all he met.
